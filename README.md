# ESS Requests

This application streamlines the process of creating training and exam requests for Esri Support Services employees. The form extrapolates some of the required information such as who to send it to and which charge code and cost center to use. Once it is submitted it generates an email and opens it in the default mail client. It also adds the request to a CSV log so that the administrator has easy access for reports.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install the node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

For development, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can also build and run the application:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

To start the app for production with https use:

```bash
npm run prod
```

## Developer Notes

Since I used Next, the client routes are taken care of in the `/pages` directory, and the api routes are in `/pages/api`. The React components are in the `/components` directory, and there are a few modules with exported functions in `/utils`. The CSVs are saved to `/data`. If there is no CSV it will create one. Otherwise, if the headers match, it will append the new request information to the existing CSV. For more specific information check out `/docs/index.html`.

### Production Deployment

The production server hosts this application on the `requests` sub directory. In order to deploy to that server you will need to change the `assetPrefix` and `basePath` settings in `next.config.js` to `'/requests/'`. I am also not including the prod server certs in this repo so you will need to generate those as well. Make sure to switch the certs used in `server.js` before deploying. **Do not use the included unsigned certs for anything other than local development.**

### Tooling

There is further documentation using JSDoc in the `docs` directory which can be regenerated by running:

```bash
npm run doc
```

I used ESLint for this project and included some VSCode settings to lint on save. You can lint your code with:

```bash
npm run lint
```

or to fix use:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

I also added some Jest test suites that you can run to make sure everything is still working:

```bash
npm run test
```
